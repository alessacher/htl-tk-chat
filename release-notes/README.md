# Versioning scheme

The htl-tk-chat uses a 3 Part Decimal Versioning Sytem, consisting of
majour, minor and release. The version is incremented as follows:

## Majour

A Majour release is announced when majour rebuilds ocur. This indicates a change
may break compatiability in one way or another.

## Minor

A minor release happens when the host gains a new feature. This does not
indicate any sort of regression and regressions within a majour release are
most likely accidental. If backwards compatiability is not given, please create
a bug-report.

## Release

A release is pushed out when bug-fixes occur, or already existing features are
improved in a way that doesn't affect their function.
